# Mathematics_Grade_Prediction
This project aims to predict the grades students will achieve using a Linear Regression Model. The datasets used for this project is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset and information about the attributes of this dataset can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance.
The data is on the grades achieved in mathematics by secondary school students in Portugal. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school-related features. The attribute G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades.
